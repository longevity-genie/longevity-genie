      "Content: Myogenic differentiation is a tightly regulated complex process in which mononucleated myoblasts proliferate, express myogenic marker proteins (MyoD, myogenin, myosin heavy chain (MyHC), etc.), and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes. Matured myotubes convert into myofibers, which are capable of muscle contraction. These multiple processes of myogenic differentiation seem to depend on numerous pathways (1,2). Extensive investigations using myoblast cell lines and tissues revealed that several extracellular growth factors modulate myogenic differentiation (3)(4)(5). Many papers have shown that insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) stimulate myoblast differentiation and are required for skeletal muscle development (6)(7)(8)(9).\n",
      "IGF-I and IGF-II are anabolic hormones with structures similar to that of proinsulin. IGFs are revealed to possess various bioactivities, including the induction of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival of target tissues. Generally, by binding to their specific receptors on the plasma membrane, IGFs activate intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The activated receptor phosphorylates several substrates, including insulin receptor substrates (IRSs). Phosphotyrosine residues in IRSs are recognized by several signaling molecules with an SH2 domain, resulting in activation of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway and Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. Activation of these pathways is shown to be required for the expression of various IGF bioactivities.\n",
      "It is well-established that IGFs are required for myogenic differentiation. In particular, in serum-free medium, myogenic differentiation was blocked and IGF addition significantly enhanced the creatine kinase level (10). Thus, IGF has an essential role in myogenic differentiation. However, it is unclear whether the activation of downstream IGF signaling pathways is constantly required for myogenesis. For example, IRS-1 knockdown C2C12 myoblasts had defects in myogenesis (11). On the other hand, we previously reported that IRS-1 overexpression inhibited myogenic differentiation in L6 myoblasts through continuous Foxo1 inhibition that might cause repression of MyHC at the late stage of differentiation (12).\n",
      "Recent reports demonstrated that apoptotic cells are necessary for the myogenic differentiation process. The phosphatidylserine receptor BAI1, which was previously linked to apoptotic cell recognition by phagocytes, promotes myoblast fusion. Blocking apoptosis during myogenic differentiation potently impaired this process; furthermore, returning apoptotic myoblasts to this system restored fusion (13). On the other hand, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling occurs during myoblast differentiation, and inhibition of ER stress signaling blocked apoptosis and myoblast differentiation. Moreover, increased ER stress enhanced differentiation-associated apoptosis of myoblasts (14). Thus, apoptosis is required for myogenic differentiation. However, the types of cells that selectively undergo apoptosis or differentiate into myotubes during myogenic differentiation remain unknown.\n",

      "Content: (i) Growth factors are generally considered to inhibit myogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 1). However, it has been reported that myoblasts in low serum medium initiate the expression of IGF-II which is secreted in significant amounts to the medium (44). It has been proposed that the insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and -II act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner on myoblasts to promote myogenic differentiation by interacting primarily with the IGF-I receptor (45). In this regard, IGFbinding proteins from muscle cells inhibit IGF-I-induced differentiation of L6E9 myoblasts (46).\n",
      "(ii) Integrins seem to play an important role in mediating signals from the extracellular matrix to influence myogenesis. Indeed, in the presence of a monoclonal antibody which blocks the function of the integrin ␤-subunit, myoblasts continue to replicate but do not fuse or express muscle-specific markers (17). Myotube formation is also inhibited by antibodies against the integrin VLA-4 and its counter-receptor VCAM-1 (18). Interestingly, an integrin-dependent translocation of PI 3-kinase to the cytoskeleton which involves specific interactions of p85␣ with actin filaments and focal adhesion kinase has been recently demonstrated in thrombin-stimulated platelets (53). Moreover, integrin and platelet-derived growth factor receptor regulate the association of PI 3-kinase with focal adhesion kinase in NIH3T3 cells (54). An analogous mechanism for PI 3-kinase activation via integrins in muscle cells would provide an explanation for the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors on myogenic differentiation.\n",
      "(iii) Many reports have recently proposed a role for a mammalian PI 3-kinase in membrane trafficking. Indeed, wortmannin and/or LY294002 have been shown to disrupt GLUT1 trafficking in L6E9 myoblasts (32), to block exocytosis of IGF-II receptors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (52), and to inhibit the sorting and transport of lysosomal enzymes (55,56). Moreover, a mammalian homolog of the yeast PI 3-kinase vacuolar protein sorting Vps34p has been recently cloned (27). Thus, PI 3-kinase inhibitors could be blocking myogenesis by disrupting the intracellular trafficking of proteins involved in the myogenic signaling through IGFs and/or integrins although other regulatory mechanisms cannot be ruled out.\n",

Recently, we found that JAK1/STAT1/STAT3 not only participate in myoblast proliferation but also actively prevent them from premature differentiation.

Interference of this pathway by either a small molecule inhibitor or small interfering RNA inhibits myogenic differentiation. Consistently, all three molecules are activated upon differentiation. The pro-differentiation effect of JAK2/STAT2/STAT3 is partially mediated by MyoD and MEF2.

A co-treatment paradigm was chosen to analyze how SDF1 interacts with these factors during myogenic differentiation. Confirming previous reports (Adi et al., 2002;Milasincic et al., 1996;Kontaridis et al., 2002), treatment of C2C12 cells with FGF2 (20 ng/ml, 48 hours) decreased myogenin protein levels by roughly 50%, whereas myogenin expression increased twofold with IGF1 (10 ng/ml; 48 hours; Fig.  6). Supplementing the culture medium additionally with SDF1 (10 ng/ml) did not further modify the inhibitory action of FGF2 on myogenin expression, but completely prevented the IGF1-induced increase in myogenin protein levels (Fig. 6).

      "Content: The basic helix-loop-helix family of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), including MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4/ Myf6/Herculin, control the skeletal myoblast differentiation process. The MRFs form heterodimers with the basic helix-loop-helix E proteins and bind to a consensus sequence called E-box. Muscle gene expression by MRFs is dependent on their interaction with members of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors. The gene PC4, also known as Tis7 or IFRD1, is involved in skeletal muscle cell differentiation and plays a role in the differentiation of adult muscle stem cells. PC4 cooperates with MyoD to induce the transcriptional activity of MEF2C by inhibiting the interaction with histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). PC4 is expressed in adult skeletal muscle and is barely detectable during embryonic development. Upregulation of PC4 in vivo enhances injury-induced muscle regeneration, while deprivation of PC4 in myoblasts leads to down-regulation of MyoD expression and impairment of terminal differentiation. PC4 acts as a repressor of NF-B transcriptional activity and enhances HDAC-mediated deacetylation of the p65 subunit. PC4 influences muscle regeneration by regulating the MyoD pathway through multiple mechanisms.\n",

Transcriptome AnalysisAbstract:The growth and development of the Longissimus Dorsi muscle are complex, playing an important role in the determination of pork quality. The study of the Longissimus Dorsi muscle at the mRNA level is particularly crucial for finding molecular approaches to improving meat quality in pig breeding. The current study utilized transcriptome technology to explore the regulatory mechanisms of muscle growth and intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition in the Longissimus Dorsi muscle at three core developmental stages (natal stage on day 1, growing stage on day 60, and finishing stage on day 210) in Ningxiang pigs. Our results revealed 441 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in common for day 1 vs. day 60 and day 60 vs. day 210, and GO (Gene Ontology) analysis showed that candidate genes RIPOR2, MEGF10, KLHL40, PLEC, TBX3, FBP2, and HOMER1 may be closely related to muscle growth and development, while KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis showed that DEGs (UBC, SLC27A5, RXRG, PRKCQ, PRKAG2, PPARGC1A, PLIN5, PLIN4, IRS2, and CPT1B) involved the PPAR (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor) signaling pathway and adipocytokine signaling pathway, which might play a pivotal role in the regulation of IMF deposition. PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction Networks) analysis found that the STAT1 gene was the top hub gene. Taken together, our results provide evidence for the molecular mechanisms of growth and development and IMF deposition in Longissimus Dorsi muscle to optimize carcass mass.Comprehensive ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analyses of the Longissimus Dorsi muscle in Luchuan and Duroc pigs revealed that the Wnt signaling pathway, the mTOR signaling pathway, and other classical pathways regulated skeletal muscle development and identified some candidate genes (ASNS, CARNS1, G0S2, PPP1R14C, and SH3BP5) that may be related to muscle development[7]. RNA-sequencing of Debao and Landrace pigs revealed that DEGs were significantly related to metabolic regulation, amino acid metabolism, muscle tissue, and muscle structure development. Meanwhile, key genes FOS, EGR2, and IL6 were identified[8]. The current research on the Longissimus Dorsi muscle compares the transcriptome results of two pig breeds (e.g., fatty and lean). Few studies focus on the regular age changes in a single pig breed. There is still a need to report on the research on the periodic changes of age mediated in the Longissimus Dorsi muscle by Ningxiang pigs. The candidate genes for muscle development are different in different pig breeds.IMF deposition is mainly dependent on the proliferation, differentiation, and lipid aggregation of adipose precursor cells, and the process of such differentiation is regulated by complex gene transcription[9]. Research on the mechanisms regulating IMF deposition is still limited. What are the molecular mechanisms underlying pork mass traits, especially intramuscular fat formation, and what are the factors involved? Currently, prior work [10] combined the transcriptome and proteome to analyze the Longissimus Dorsi muscle tissue of individual Nanyang black pigs with high and low levels of genetic variation and identified 15 genes as candidates for determining genetic differences in fat deposition, among which genes associated with lipid deposition (ACACA, ACSL4, and SCD) and PPARA-centered lipid metabolism regulators (PPARA and UCP3). As previously reported, Cheng et al. performed whole-transcriptome profiling of individuals with high and low intramuscular fat IMF content, respectively, in the F2 resource population of the Large White Pig × Min Pig, and the results revealed 218 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) with differentially expressed genes mainly involved in cell differentiation, fatty acid synthesis, phylogeny, muscle fiber development, and regulation of lipid metabolism[11]. In addition, a total of 97 DE regulatory RNAs could be identified in quantitative trait locus (QTLs) associated with IMF. The Ningxiang pig is a typical fatty pig breed; however, there is no relevant study on the principles and specific regulatory mechanisms of IMF deposition in the Ningxiang pig.Pigs, diploids with 18 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, are highly similar to humans in terms of anatomy, physiology, and genome, making them an ideal animal model for biomedical research[12]. The distinctive features of Ningxiang pigs are excellent muscle quality and high intramuscular fat content[13], which is much higher than exotic breeds, but the research on the excellent germplasm characteristics of Ningxiang pigs is not deep enough, especially the regulatory mechanisms of traits such as muscle growth and IMF, which need to be analyzed. Therefore, in order to investigate the differential genes in the Longissimus Dorsi muscle of Ningxiang pigs' natal stage (day 1), growing stage (day 60), and finishing stage (day 210) of growth periods, the tissues were selected as the study materials to explore the differences and similarities of gene expression in Ningxiang pigs at the mRNA level. The results of the current study could provide a reference for further research on the function and mechanism of mRNA in the Longissimus Dorsi muscle of Ningxiang pigs, as well as an understanding of developmental characteristics in actual production. ). A total of 9 healthy half-sibling Ningxiang male piglets of similar body weight were randomly selected, and all experimental pigs were fed nutritional standards and managed in the same manner and under the same conditions from birth. Longissimus Dorsi muscle samples were collected at slaughter during the natal stage (day 1), growing stage (day 60), and finishing stage (day 210) of growth periods, and three tails were randomly selected at each stage (n = 3). At the growing stage, all pigs were fed the same\"]}),\n  Document(page_content='Myogenic differentiation is a tightly regulated complex process in which mononucleated myoblasts proliferate, express myogenic marker proteins (MyoD, myogenin, myosin heavy chain (MyHC), etc.), and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes. Matured myotubes convert into myofibers, which are capable of muscle contraction. These multiple processes of myogenic differentiation seem to depend on numerous pathways (1,2). Extensive investigations using myoblast cell lines and tissues revealed that several extracellular growth factors modulate myogenic differentiation (3)(4)(5). Many papers have shown that insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) stimulate myoblast differentiation and are required for skeletal muscle development (6)(7)(8)(9).\\nIGF-I and IGF-II are anabolic hormones with structures similar to that of proinsulin. IGFs are revealed to possess various bioactivities, including the induction of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival of target tissues. Generally, by binding to their specific receptors on the plasma membrane, IGFs activate intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The activated receptor phosphorylates several substrates, including insulin receptor substrates (IRSs). Phosphotyrosine residues in IRSs are recognized by several signaling molecules with an SH2 domain, resulting in activation of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway and Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. Activation of these pathways is shown to be required for the expression of various IGF bioactivities.\\nIt is well-established that IGFs are required for myogenic differentiation. In particular, in serum-free medium, myogenic differentiation was blocked and IGF addition significantly enhanced the creatine kinase level (10). Thus, IGF has an essential role in myogenic differentiation. However, it is unclear whether the activation of downstream IGF signaling pathways is constantly required for myogenesis. For example, IRS-1 knockdown C2C12 myoblasts had defects in myogenesis (11). On the other hand, we previously reported that IRS-1 overexpression inhibited myogenic differentiation in L6 myoblasts through continuous Foxo1 inhibition that might cause repression of MyHC at the late stage of differentiation (12).\\nRecent reports demonstrated that apoptotic cells are necessary for the myogenic differentiation process. The phosphatidylserine receptor BAI1, which was previously linked to apoptotic cell recognition by phagocytes, promotes myoblast fusion. Blocking apoptosis during myogenic differentiation potently impaired this process; furthermore, returning apoptotic myoblasts to this system restored fusion (13). On the other hand, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling occurs during myoblast differentiation, and inhibition of ER stress signaling blocked apoptosis and myoblast differentiation. Moreover, increased ER stress enhanced differentiation-associated apoptosis of myoblasts (14). Thus, apoptosis is required for myogenic differentiation. However, the types of cells that selectively undergo apoptosis or differentiate into myotubes during myogenic differentiation remain unknown.', metadata={'externalids_pubmed': '32180762', 'source': '10.3389/fendo.2020.00096#6', 'annotations_title': ['Myoblasts With Higher IRS-1 Levels Are Eliminated From the Normal Cell Layer During Differentiation', 'Myoblasts With Higher IRS-1 Levels Are Eliminated From the Normal Cell Layer During Differentiation'], 'annotations_author': ['Gaetano Santulli ', 'Emilio J Vélez ', 'Ling Lu ', 'Fumihiko Hakuno ahakuno@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp† ', 'Yosuke Yoneyama ', 'Ryosuke Okino \\nDepartments of Animal Sciences and Applied Biological Chemistry\\nGraduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nTokyoJapan\\n', 'Ami Usui \\nDepartments of Animal Sciences and Applied Biological Chemistry\\nGraduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nTokyoJapan\\n', 'Yosuke Yoneyama \\nDepartments of Animal Sciences and Applied Biological Chemistry\\nGraduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nTokyoJapan\\n', '† ', 'Shin-Ichiro Takahashi \\nDepartments of Animal Sciences and Applied Biological Chemistry\\nGraduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nTokyoJapan\\n', 'Fumihiko Hakuno \\nDepartments of Animal Sciences and Applied Biological Chemistry\\nGraduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nTokyoJapan\\n\\nDepartments of Animal Sciences and Applied Biological Chemistry\\nGraduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences\\nLaboratory of Cell Regulation\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nTokyoJapan\\n', '\\nColumbia University\\nUnited States\\n', '\\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\\nCanada\\n', '\\nInstitute of Research\\nOcean University of China\\nChina\\n', '\\nTokyo Medical and Dental University\\nTokyoJapan\\n'], 'corpusid': 211534874, 'paragraph': 6, 'split': '1', 'updated': '2022-01-31T04:53:32Z', 'externalids_doi': '10.3389/fendo.2020.00096', 'doi': '10.3389/fendo.2020.00096', 'content_source_oainfo_openaccessurl': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2020.00096/pdf', 'annotations_abstract': ['Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 is a major substrate of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptors. It is well-known that IGF-I and II play essential roles in myogenesis progression. Herein, we report an unexpected phenomenon that IRS-1-overexpressing L6 myoblasts are eliminated from normal cell layers at the beginning of differentiation. Initially, the IRS protein level and apoptosis were examined during myogenic differentiation in L6 myoblasts. We found that the IRS-1 protein level decreased, whereas active caspase 3 increased around 1 day after induction of differentiation. The addition of a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, inhibited differentiation-induced suppression of the IRS-1 protein level. Apoptosis was not enhanced in L6 myoblasts stably expressing high levels of IRS-1 (L6-IRS-1). However, when L6-IRS-1 was cultured with control cells (L6-mock), we observed that L6-IRS-1 was eliminated from the cell layer. We have recently reported that, in L6-IRS-1, internalization of the IGF-I receptor was delayed and IGF signal activation was sustained for a longer period than in L6-mock. When cells stably expressing IRS-1 3YA mutant, which could not maintain the IGF signals, were cultured with normal cells, elimination from the cell layer was not detected. These data suggested that the high level of IRS-1 in myoblasts induces elimination from the cell layer due to abnormal sustainment of IGF-I receptor activation.']}),\n  Document(page_content='(i) Growth factors are generally considered to inhibit myogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 1). However, it has been reported that myoblasts in low serum medium initiate the expression of IGF-II which is secreted in significant amounts to the medium (44). It has been proposed that the insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and -II act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner on myoblasts to promote myogenic differentiation by interacting primarily with the IGF-I receptor (45). In this regard, IGFbinding proteins from muscle cells inhibit IGF-I-induced differentiation of L6E9 myoblasts (46).\\n(ii) Integrins seem to play an important role in mediating signals from the extracellular matrix to influence myogenesis. Indeed, in the presence of a monoclonal antibody which blocks the function of the integrin ␤-subunit, myoblasts continue to replicate but do not fuse or express muscle-specific markers (17). Myotube formation is also inhibited by antibodies against the integrin VLA-4 and its counter-receptor VCAM-1 (18). Interestingly, an integrin-dependent translocation of PI 3-kinase to the cytoskeleton which involves specific interactions of p85␣ with actin filaments and focal adhesion kinase has been recently demonstrated in thrombin-stimulated platelets (53). Moreover, integrin and platelet-derived growth factor receptor regulate the association of PI 3-kinase with focal adhesion kinase in NIH3T3 cells (54). An analogous mechanism for PI 3-kinase activation via integrins in muscle cells would provide an explanation for the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors on myogenic differentiation.\\n(iii) Many reports have recently proposed a role for a mammalian PI 3-kinase in membrane trafficking. Indeed, wortmannin and/or LY294002 have been shown to disrupt GLUT1 trafficking in L6E9 myoblasts (32), to block exocytosis of IGF-II receptors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (52), and to inhibit the sorting and transport of lysosomal enzymes (55,56). Moreover, a mammalian homolog of the yeast PI 3-kinase vacuolar protein sorting Vps34p has been recently cloned (27). Thus, PI 3-kinase inhibitors could be blocking myogenesis by disrupting the intracellular trafficking of proteins involved in the myogenic signaling through IGFs and/or integrins although other regulatory mechanisms cannot be ruled out.', metadata={'doi': '10.1074/jbc.271.32.19146', 'source': '10.1074/jbc.271.32.19146#15', 'annotations_title': ['Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Inhibitors Block Differentiation of Skeletal Muscle Cells*', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Inhibitors Block Differentiation of Skeletal Muscle Cells*', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Inhibitors Block Differentiation of Skeletal Muscle Cells*', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Inhibitors Block Differentiation of Skeletal Muscle Cells*'], 'annotations_author': ['Perla Kaliman \\nDepartament de Bioquímica i Biologia Molecular\\nFacultat de Biologia\\nUniversitat de Barcelona\\nAvda.

In contrast, in C2C12 cells overexpressing Nox4, the fusion index was increased, whereas the differentiation index and MHC and myogenin protein expression were not affected compared to control. Interestingly, the expression of myomaker (Tmem8c), a fusogenic protein that controls myoblast fusion, was reduced in Nox4-knockdown C2C12 cells. The myomaker expression level was proportional to the cellular ROS level, which was regulated by of Nox4 expression level.

In addition to its function as an extracellular matrix organizer, it has the ability to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor, and it forms complexes with various isoforms of transforming growth factor ␤ (TGF-␤). Decorin is expressed during skeletal muscle differentiation and is up-regulated in dystrophic muscle. In this study we investigated the role of decorin in TGF-␤؊dependent inhibition of myogenesis. To probe the function of decorin during myogenesis, C 2 C 12 myoblasts were stably transfected with a plasmid expressing antisense decorin mRNA. The resulting inhibition of decorin expression led to the expression of myogenin, a master transcription factor for muscle differentiation, under growth conditions and accelerated skeletal muscle differentiation as determined by the expression of creatine kinase. In contrast myogenin expression was inhibited by adenovirally induced decorin expression or by adding exogenous decorin. Reduced synthesis of decorin resulted in a 7-fold decreased sensitivity to TGF-␤؊mediated inhibition of myogenin expression. In contrast, adenovirally induced decorin expression in wild type cells resulted in a 5-fold increased sensitivity to TGF-␤؊mediated inhibition of myogenin expression. Transfection studies with the TGF-␤-dependent promoter of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 coupled with luciferase revealed that the transducing receptors for TGF-␤1 and TGF-␤2 were involved in the different responses of wild type and anti-sense decorin myoblasts. These results demonstrate that a reduction of decorin expression or of decorin availability results in a decreased responsiveness to TGF-␤. These findings strongly suggest a new role for decorin during skeletal muscle terminal differentiation by activating TGF-␤-dependent signaling pathways.']}),\n  Document(page_content='Expression of different myogenic markers could be observed under all conditions.\\nIn co-cultures, the early stimulation (2 d) with HGF demonstrated significant and highly significant upregulations of MEF2 using 10, 30 and 60 ng/ml compared with late stimulation (7 d).\\nBoth MEF2 and ACTN2 expressions were equal or upregulated during early stimulation compared with unstimulated control groups.\\nIn MSC monocultures, the strongest MEF2 expression (1.6 ± 0.6-fold) could be achieved with 10 ng/ml HGF after stimulation for over 7 d.\\nExcept in groups with 30 ng/ml HGF, long-term stimulation achieved almost equal or higher levels of MEF2 and ACTN2 in MSCs compared with controls.\\nVarying results were observed in myoblast monocultures: Early stimulation with 10-60 ng/ml HGF induced a concentration-dependent upregulation of MEF2 and ACTN2.\\nComparing the three different cell groups, it could be demonstrated that early stimulation with HGF increased the levels of myogenic markers especially in co-cultures and myoblast monocultures, whereas in MSCs this occurred during long-term stimulation.\\nEffects of IGF-1 on mRNA level of different myogenic markers in MSC co-cultivated with primary myoblasts and in monocultures MSC and primary rat myoblasts were co-and monocultured in basic differentiation medium containing IGF-1 and in control medium without IGF-1 for 2 d and 7 d.\\nExpression of MEF2 and ACTN2 could be observed under all conditions.\\nA highly significant and significant higher expression of MEF2 could be detected in MSC and myoblast co-cultures after 2 d compared with 7 d in the 10 and 30 ng/ml IGF-1 group.\\nACTN2 expression was upregulated during early stimulation compared with unstimulated control groups.\\nIn MSC monocultures, stimulation with 60 ng/ml IGF-1 over 2 d induced the strongest upregulation of MEF2 (1.2 ± 0.4-fold).\\nACTN2 expression was overall increased during early stimulation.\\nMb monocultures were influenced positively by early stimulation with IGF-1: An overall increase of MEF2 and ACTN2 was observed after 2 d.\\nDuring early stimulation, MEF2 expression increased in co-cultures and myoblast monocultures the most.\\nHighest ACTN2 expressions were seen in myoblast monocultures.\\nIn MSC monocultures, as well as in co-cultures with myoblasts, higher expressions of DES compared with myoblasts (=1) could be observed.\\nCultivation in HGF/ IGF-1 free medium achieved highest levels of DES (MSC: 218.5 ± 219-fold; MSC + Mb: 64.5 ± 62-fold) after 2 d.\\nDuring early stimulation, MSC monocultures showed overall higher levels of DES than co-cultures.\\nMYOG expression was upregulated under HGF stimulation compared with myoblasts under HGF after 14 d.\\nMYOG could only be detected in one out of three experiments and merely in co-cultures.\\nAfter 14 d, in co-cultures, highest levels of ACTN2 (5.9 ± 14fold) and MyHC2 (4.8 ± 2.3-fold) could be observed under IGF-1 stimulation.\\nIGFBP4 expression increased in co-and monocultures with growth factors compared with cultivation in control medium without HGF/IGF-1.\\nIGFBP5 and -6 expression in co-cultures was elevated in the IGF-1 group compared with groups without growth factors.\\nIn MSC monocultures, hardly any expression of IGFBP5 and -6 could be detected.', metadata={'annotations_author': ['R Witt ', 'A Weigand ', '† ', 'A M Boos ', 'A Cai ', 'D Dippold ', 'A R Boccaccini ', 'D W Schubert ', 'M Hardt ', 'C Lange ', 'A Arkudas ', 'R E Horch ', 'J P Beier '], 'source': '10.1186/s12860-017-0131-2#10', 'annotations_title': ['Mesenchymal stem cells and myoblast differentiation under HGF and IGF-1 stimulation for 3D skeletal muscle tissue engineering', 'Mesenchymal stem cells and myoblast differentiation under HGF and IGF-1 stimulation for 3D skeletal muscle tissue engineering'], 'externalids_pubmed': '28245809', 'doi': '10.1186/s12860-017-0131-2', 'paragraph': 10, 'split': '1', 'corpusid': 25847427, 'externalids_doi': '10.1186/s12860-017-0131-2', 'updated': '2022-03-11T13:42:29Z', 'content_source_oainfo_openaccessurl': 'https://bmcmolcellbiol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12860-017-0131-2', 'annotations_abstract': ['Background: Volumetric muscle loss caused by trauma or after tumour surgery exceeds the natural regeneration capacity of skeletal muscle. Hence, the future goal of tissue engineering (TE) is the replacement and repair of lost muscle tissue by newly generating skeletal muscle combining different cell sources, such as myoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), within a three-dimensional matrix. Latest research showed that seeding skeletal muscle cells on aligned constructs enhance the formation of myotubes as well as cell alignment and may provide a further step towards the clinical application of engineered skeletal muscle. In this study the myogenic differentiation potential of MSCs upon co-cultivation with myoblasts and under stimulation with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was evaluated. We further analysed the behaviour of MSC-myoblast co-cultures in different 3D matrices.Results: Primary rat myoblasts and rat MSCs were mono-and co-cultivated for 2, 7 or 14 days. The effect of different concentrations of HGF and IGF-1 alone, as well as in combination, on myogenic differentiation was analysed using microscopy, multicolour flow cytometry and real-time PCR. Furthermore, the influence of different three-dimensional culture models, such as fibrin, fibrin-collagen-I gels and parallel aligned electrospun poly-εcaprolacton collagen-I nanofibers, on myogenic differentiation was analysed. MSCs could be successfully differentiated into the myogenic lineage both in mono-and in co-cultures independent of HGF and IGF-1 stimulation by expressing desmin, myocyte enhancer factor 2, myosin heavy chain 2 and alpha-sarcomeric actinin. An increased expression of different myogenic key markers could be observed under HGF and IGF-1 stimulation. Even though, stimulation with HGF/IGF-1 does not seem essential for sufficient myogenic differentiation.

Betaglycan expression, as determined by Northern and Western blot, was up-regulated during the conversion of myoblasts to myotubes. The mouse betaglycan gene promoter was cloned, and its sequence showed putative binding sites for SP1, Smad3, Smad4, muscle regulatory factor elements such as MyoD and MEF2, and retinoic acid receptor. Transcriptional activity of the mouse betaglycan promoter reporter was also up-regulated in differentiating C 2 C 12 cells. We found that MyoD, but not myogenin, stimulated this transcriptional activity even in the presence of high serum. Betaglycan promoter activity was increased by RA and inhibited by the three isoforms of TGF-␤. On the other hand, basic fibroblast growth factor, BMP-2, and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, which are inhibitors of myogenesis, had little effect. In myotubes, up-regulated betaglycan was also detectable by TGF-␤ affinity labeling and immunofluorescence microscopy studies. The latter indicated that betaglycan was localized both on the cell surface and in the ECM. Forced expression of betaglycan in C 2 C 12 myoblasts increases their responsiveness to TGF-␤2, suggesting that it performs a TGF-␤ presentation function in this cell lineage.

In this study, we show that up-regulation of PC4 in vivo in adult muscle significantly potentiates injury-induced regeneration by enhancing myogenesis. Conversely, we observe that PC4 silencing in myoblasts causes delayed exit from the cell cycle, accompanied by delayed differentiation, and we show that such an effect is MyoD-dependent. We provide evidence revealing a novel mechanism underlying the promyogenic actions of PC4, by which PC4 functions as a negative regulator of NF-B, known to inhibit MyoD expression posttranscriptionally. In fact, up-regulation of PC4 in primary myoblasts induces the deacetylation, and hence the inactivation and nuclear export of NF-B p65, in concomitance with induction of MyoD expression. On the contrary, PC4 silencing in myoblasts induces the acetylation and nuclear import of p65, in parallel with a decrease of MyoD levels. We also observe that PC4 potentiates the inhibition of NF-B transcriptional activity mediated by histone deacetylases and that PC4 is able to form trimolecular complexes with p65 and HDAC3. This suggests that PC4 stimulates deacetylation of p65 by favoring the recruitment of HDAC3 to p65.

In addition, radiolabeled tracer experiments demonstrated that both mature and high M r IGF-II isoforms have similar binding profiles in fetal bovine serum and have similar affinities for IGF-II-binding proteins secreted from human fibroblasts. Finally, the biological activity of high M r IGF-II was shown to be similar to or slightly better than mature IGF-II in stimulating amino acid uptake in fibroblasts and in inducing myoblast differentiation.']}),\n  Document(page_content='To induce the myogenic differentiation of the T-MSCs, the cells were plated in a 10-cm Petri dish in low-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.

Previously, we reported that the tonsils can be an excellent reservoir of MSCs for the regeneration of skeletal muscle (SKM) damage. However, the mechanisms involved in the differentiation from tonsil-derived MSCs (T-MSCs) to myocytes via myoblasts remain unclear. To clarify these mechanisms, we analyzed gene expression profiles of T-MSCs during differentiation into myocytes compared with human skeletal muscle cells (hSKMCs). Total RNA was extracted from T-MSCs, T-MSCderived myoblasts and myocytes, and hSKMCs and was subjected to analysis using a microarray. Microarray analysis of the three phases of myogenic differentiation identified candidate genes associated with myogenic differentiation. The expression pattern of undifferentiated T-MSCs was distinguishable from the myogenic differentiated T-MSCs and hSKMCs. In particular, we selected FNBP1L, which among the upregulated genes is essential for antibacterial autophagy, since autophagy is related to SKM metabolism and myogenesis. T-MSCs differentiated toward myoblasts and skeletal myocytes sequentially, as evidenced by increased expression of autophagy-related markers (including Beclin-1, LC3B and Atg5) and decreased expression of Bcl-2. Furthermore, we reconfirmed that autophagy has an effect on the mechanism of skeletal myogenic differentiation derived from T-MSCs by treatment with 5-azacytidine and bafilomycin A1. These data suggest that the transcriptome of the T-MSC-derived myocytes is similar to that of hSKMCs, and that autophagy has an important role in the mechanism of myogenic differentiation of T-MSCs.']}),\n  Document(page_content='Contribute to muscle regeneration.

In the present work we show that both HGF/SF and met are coexpressed by undifferentiated C2 mouse myoblasts. In growing cells, the autocrine loop is active as the receptor exhibits a constitutive phosphorylation on tyrosine that can be abrogated by exogenously added anti-HGF/SF neutralizing antibodies. The transcription of HGF / SF and met genes is downregulated when myoblasts stop proliferating and differentiate. The coexpression of HGF / SF and met genes is not exclusive to C2 cells since it has been assessed also in other myogenic cell lines and in mouse primary satellite cells, suggesting that HGF/SF could play a role in muscle development through an autocrine way.To analyze the biological effects of HGF/SF receptor activation, we stably expressed the constitutively acti-vated receptor catalytic domain (p65 tpr-met ) in C2 cells. This active kinase determined profound changes in cell shape and inhibited myogenesis at both morphological and biochemical levels. Notably, a complete absence of muscle regulatory markers such as MyoD and myogenin was observed in p65 tpr-met highly expressing C2 clones. We also studied the effects of the ectopic expression of human isoforms of met receptor (h-met ) and of HGF/SF (h-HGF/SF) in stable transfected C2 cells. Single constitutive expression of h-met or h-HGF/SF does not alter substantially the growth and differentiation properties of the myoblast cells, probably because of a species-specific ligand-receptor interaction. A C2 clone expressing simultaneously both h-met and h-HGF/SF is able to grow in soft agar and shows a decrease in myogenic potential comparable to that promoted by p65 tpr-met kinase. These data indicate that a met kinase signal released from differentiation-dependent control provides a negative stimulus for the onset of myogenic differentiation.']}),\n  Document(page_content='IGF-1 was also able to regulate the protein content of SK1 and SK2.\\nmyoblast treatment with 50 ng/ml IGF-1 strongly increased the expression of both the myogenic markers at 24 and 48 h.\\nthe IGF-1-dependent myogenic process strictly depends on the activation of SK.\\nthe three-fold IGF-1-dependent increase of myogenin expression was totally abrogated when SK1 was downregulated by RNA interference, while caveolin-3 content, increased by the growth factor by approximately 3.5-fold, was robustly decreased.\\nthe myogenic effect of IGF-1 was also reduced when SK2 was downregulated by specific RNA interference.\\nexogenous S1P exerts pro-myogenic action in C2C12 cells via engagement of the S1P 2 receptor.\\nthe myogenic action exerted by IGF-1 was mediated by S1P 2 engagement in myoblasts.\\nsiRNA directed against S1P 2 , which significantly reduced the receptor expression, strongly attenuated the enhancement of myogenin elicited by IGF-1 (approximately three-fold) and abrogated the increase of caveolin-3.\\nthe downregulation of the other receptor isoforms, S1P 1 , S1P 3 or S1P 4 , by specific siRNA did not alter the myogenic effect of the growth factor.\\ntransactivation of S1P 2 by IGF-1 is implicated in the myogenic effect of the growth factor in myoblasts.', metadata={'updated': '2022-03-23T04:36:26Z', 'source': '10.1186/2044-5040-2-15#7', 'externalids_pubmed': '22788716', 'annotations_title': ['Sphingosine kinase/sphingosine 1-phosphate axis: a new player for insulin-like growth factor-1- induced myoblast differentiation', 'Sphingosine kinase/sphingosine 1-phosphate axis: a new player for insulin-like growth factor-1- induced myoblast differentiation'], 'doi': '10.1186/2044-5040-2-15', 'paragraph': 7, 'split': '1', 'corpusid': 8243576, 'externalids_doi': '10.1186/2044-5040-2-15', 'annotations_author': ['Caterina Bernacchioni ', 'Francesca Cencetti ', 'Sabrina Blescia ', 'Chiara Donati ', 'Paola Bruni '], 'content_source_oainfo_openaccessurl': 'https://skeletalmusclejournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/2044-5040-2-15', 'annotations_abstract': ['Background: Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is the most important physiological regulator of skeletal muscle progenitor cells, which are responsible for adult skeletal muscle regeneration. The ability of IGF-1 to affect multiple aspects of skeletal muscle cell biology such as proliferation, differentiation, survival and motility is well recognized, although the molecular mechanisms implicated in its complex biological action are not fully defined. Since sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) has recently emerged as a key player in skeletal muscle regeneration, we investigated the possible involvement of the sphingosine kinase (SK)/S1P receptor axis on the biological effects of IGF-1 in murine myoblasts. Methods: RNA interference, chemical inhibition and immunofluorescence approaches were used to assess the role of the SK/S1P axis on the myogenic and mitogenic effects of IGF-1 in C2C12 myoblasts.Results: We show that IGF-1 increases SK activity in mouse myoblasts. The effect of the growth factor does not involve transcriptional regulation of SK1 or SK2, since the protein content of both isoforms is not affected; rather, IGF-1 enhances the fraction of the active form of SK. Moreover, transactivation of the S1P 2 receptor induced by IGF-1 via SK activation appears to be involved in the myogenic effect of the growth factor. Indeed, the prodifferentiating effect of IGF-1 in myoblasts is impaired when SK activity is pharmacologically inhibited, or SK1 or SK2 are specifically silenced, or the S1P 2 receptor is downregulated. Furthermore, in this study we show that IGF-1 transactivates S1P 1 /S1P 3 receptors via SK activation and that this molecular event negatively regulates the mitogenic effect elicited by the growth factor, since the specific silencing of S1P 1 or S1P 3 receptors increases cell proliferation induced by IGF-1. Conclusions: We demonstrate a dual role of the SK/S1P axis in response to myoblast challenge with IGF-1, that likely is important to regulate the biological effect of this growth factor. These findings add new information to the understanding of the mechanism by which IGF-1 regulates skeletal muscle regeneration.']})],\n 'generated_question': 'What are all the relevant growth factors essential for myoblast differentiation?'}"
